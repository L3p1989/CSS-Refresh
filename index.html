        <h2>The Lost Years of Merlin</h2>
        <p>
          A raging sea tosses a boy upon the shores of ancient Wales. Left for
          dead, he has no memory, no name, and no home. But it is his
          determination to find out who he is - to learn the truth about his
          mysterious powers - that leads him to a strange and enchanted land.
          And it is there he discovers that the fate of this land and his
          personal quest are strangely entwined. He is destined to become the
          greatest wizard of all time--known to all as Merlin. "An extraordinary
          journey of mind, body, and spirit - for both Merlin and ourselves."

        <h2>Da Vinci Code</h2>
        <p>
          While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a
          phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre
          has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling
          symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort
          through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of
          clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all
          to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Even more
          startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a
          secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo,
          and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless
          Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding
          the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive,
          ancient truth will be lost forever. (less)

        <h2>The Golden Compass</h2>
        <p>
          Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored
          bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they
          steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle
          Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world. Can one small
          girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is
          Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a champion
          as Roger or Asriel could want--but what Lyra doesn't know is that to
          help one of them will be to betray the other.
