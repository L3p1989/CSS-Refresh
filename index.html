        <h2>The Lost Years of Merlin</h2>
        <p>
          A raging sea tosses a boy upon the shores of ancient Wales. Left for
          dead, he has no memory, no name, and no home. But it is his
          determination to find out who he is - to learn the truth about his
          mysterious powers - that leads him to a strange and enchanted land.
          And it is there he discovers that the fate of this land and his
          personal quest are strangely entwined. He is destined to become the
          greatest wizard of all time--known to all as Merlin. "An extraordinary
          journey of mind, body, and spirit - for both Merlin and ourselves."
