        <h2>The Lost Years of Merlin</h2>
        <!--Description-->
        <p>
          A raging sea tosses a boy upon the shores of ancient Wales. Left for
          dead, he has no memory, no name, and no home. But it is his
          determination to find out who he is - to learn the truth about his
          <span>mysterious powers</span> - that leads him to a strange and
          enchanted land. And it is there he discovers that the fate of this
          land and his personal quest are strangely entwined. He is destined to
          become the greatest wizard of all time--known to all as Merlin. "An
          extraordinary journey of mind, body, and spirit - for both Merlin and
          ourselves."

        <h2>Da Vinci Code</h2>
        <!--Description-->
        <p>
          While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a
          phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre
          has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in
          <span>baffling symbols</span>. As Langdon and gifted French
          cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are
          stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo
          da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by
          the painter. Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the
          Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac
          Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking
          historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the
          labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows
          their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.

        <h2>The Golden Compass</h2>
        <!--Description-->
        <p>
          Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored
          bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they
          steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle
          Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world. Can one small
          girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is
          Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true
          <span>a champion</span>
          as Roger or Asriel could want--but what Lyra doesn't know is that to
          help one of them will be to betray the other.
